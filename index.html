									My journey into exploring anything computer began a long time ago, blurry but still in that direction. I had the opportunity to play and interact with computers at a young age.Looking back, I can confidently say that it was my initiation into the computer world.
								</p>

								<p>
									University Degree: <br/>
									The journey officially began with my Information Technology degree, which I began in 2020 with a tentative graduation date of 2024. Studying it at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
									It has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs. Learning new things every day and, even better, learning new things with others who share the same vision. It has been fun interacting with people from all walks of life and collaborating with them, getting to know different ideologies and cultures.
								</p>

								<p>
									Networking: <br/>
									During a semester break, I got to know about networking, and as I didn't have a clear vision of where I would want to end up with the degree, I decided to take it up in August 2021. I later fell in love with networks and anything connected. It is fascinating how the world as we know it has been reduced to a global village.
									Communication with someone halfway around the world has been reduced to milliseconds. Technologies created around making this latency even smaller are fascinating. I was able to study and pass my Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam in May 2022 after almost 10 months of dedicated study. It was a defining moment in my networking career.
									I am actively pursuing my Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) certificate.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mobile App Development: <br/>
									In 2022, Grow with Google, Andela, and Pluralsight joined forces to launch the Google Africa Developer Scholarship (GADS) program. Its primary objective was to engage and support aspiring and established developers on their path towards becoming professional developers, equipped with the necessary skills to pass Google certifications and demonstrate readiness for employment.
									This program offers the latest content curated by industry experts on the Pluralsight platform, enabling participants to access valuable resources. Additionally, it provides a platform for interaction with a vibrant community of over 30,000 members who share a common interest.
									During the programme's six-month duration, I actively participated in its various stages. I found immense value in the diverse learning materials provided and benefited greatly from collaborative peer programming during the project phase.
									I got to interact and make friends with many people from different countries and cultures across Africa. This highly influenced my thinking towards creating software, not only to solve local problems but also to solve problems being faced by different groups of people.
									Our team focused on a fintech project within the crowdfunding space in Africa, where I assumed the role of the lead Android developer. Our project's excellence led to its selection among the ten qualifying teams for the final presentation phase. Although we didn't secure the first position, it was a tremendous honour and accomplishment to witness the transformation of an idea into an executed product.
									Furthermore, the programme featured a special event called "Spotlight Week," where participants could submit their applications for consideration. I was thrilled to have one of my projects chosen for the spotlight, giving it the opportunity to be showcased during the town hall meetings.
									Overall, my experience in the GADS programme was invaluable, providing me with substantial knowledge, real-world project experience, and the chance to connect with a thriving developer community.
									This was the first time I got to collaborate on a project at that scale and of that importance. It was quite a humbling experience being a lead Android Developer on that project and also being certified as a Google Developer in native Android development after the programme ended in November 2022.
								</p>
								<p>
									Web Development: <br/>
									I was recruited to join Leizam Ventures somewhere around December 2022, towards the end of the GADS program. I joined them in January 2023, where I collaborated with a dynamic team to create innovative solutions.
									I actively engage in team meetings, brainstorming sessions, and comprehensive code reviews, which foster an environment that encourages the sharing and refinement of ideas, ultimately resulting in practical and impactful solutions.
									One case was when we were creating a website solution for a company that helps emigrants have a smooth process when relocating and trying to find a job. The website solution was needed to create a centralised place where the documents could be uploaded and shared with the necessary people.
									One notable feature I highly contributed to creating was the chat application inside the website where agents and customers could have a live conversation, as well as the administrator and agents. This was a real-time chat application where we used the SignalR library of the .NET framework to achieve this.
									I also helped design the questionnaire that was going to be used to get to know more about the customers before using the site so as to smoothen the process and tailor it to suit the given customer given the answers he or she chooses.
									My compulsory university attachment happened to run at the same time I was working with them, so I took it there. I am learning new things every day and getting better at both C# and the .NET framework. I am getting better at my knowledge of relational databases (MySql) and writing better queries.
									I am getting to familiarise myself with Javascript, especially KnockOut Js (a library in Javascript). KnockOut JS is used when making API calls in the frontend and dynamically binding the data to HTML.
